# Tailwind CSS Gradient Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS gradients, and provides a solution.

The issue involves the `bg-gradient-to-r` utility not rendering the gradient correctly. The expected output is a smooth transition between blue and purple, but the actual output might be unexpected. 

## Solution:

Ensure you have correctly imported Tailwind CSS and configured your project. Double-check that there are no conflicting styles that might override the gradient styles. In some cases, adjusting the order of CSS rules or adding important tags might be necessary, but those are less common causes.

This example includes working code to fix this issue.
